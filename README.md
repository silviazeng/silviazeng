A business-professional-turned **Machine Learning** hobbyist and coder.

- 👩🏻‍💼 I was an investment banker and MIT MBA in my past life. Some great Machine Learning engineers I met at work planted the seed.
- 🔭 I’m in the process of exploring, with a recent focus on ML applications in media & entertainment.
- 👯 I’m looking for job opportunities to become a **Machine Learning PM** or a business thought partner to passionate Engineers and Data Scientists!

🌱 Some great beginner-friendly resources over which I taught myself Machine Learning:
- Linear Algebra: [MIT OpenCourseWare Linear Algebra by Gilbert Strang](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL221E2BBF13BECF6C) (💗my forever favoriate)
- Statistics: tried several MIT OCW courses, but still haven't found a good one for ML, let me know if you have any in mind!
- Machine Learning Walk-through: [Machine Learning Coursera course by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction#courses) (a good overview within a relative short time, and useful check to see where the mathematical review are needed)
- Hands–On Machine Learning with Scikit–Learn and TensorFlow 2ed published by O’Reilly (though I got stuck halfway setting up TensorFlow environment... it's still my No.1 recommendations to beginners like me. You will also have the chance to familiarize yourself with Python along the way)
