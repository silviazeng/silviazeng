A business-professional-turned **Machine Learning** hobbyist and coder.

- 👩🏻‍💼 I was an investment banker and MIT MBA in my past life. Some great Machine Learning engineers I met at work planted the seed.
- 🔭 I’m in the process of exploring, with a recent focus on ML applications in media & entertainment.
- 👯 I’m looking for opportunities to work with passionate ML Engineers and Data Scientists as a business thought partner!

🌱 Some great beginner-friendly resources over which I taught myself Machine Learning:
- Linear Algebra: [Linear Algebra by Gilbert Strang (MIT OpenCourseWare)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL221E2BBF13BECF6C) (a godsend, ❤️my forever favoriate! A more advanced 18.065 Matrix Method is also available, but not as divine as 18.06 Linear Algebra)
- Statistics: tried several MIT OCW courses, but still haven't found a good one for ML, let me know if you have any in mind!
- ML Basics Walk-through: [Machine Learning Coursera course by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction#courses) (it doesn't cover more advanced topics, but still a quick entry-level overview, and useful check to see where the mathematical review are needed)
- [Hands–On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow **2ed**](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1492032646) by O’Reilly (it's still my No.1 recommendations to beginners like me, till the next edition comes out. You will also have the chance to familiarize yourself with Python along the way)
- If you don't enjoy reading papers, [some (relatively) begginner friendly videos on milestone papers](https://www.youtube.com/@AI-qb8eh/videos)(only Chinese version available, but there are plenty others on Youtube)
- Additionally, **ChatGPT** turns out to be quite helpful explaining codes and sometimes fixing bugs (though it makes up some non-existent API or syntax from time to time...)
